# Machine-Learning-Models-for-Student-Retention

This repository compiles a set of machine learning models created to tackle the important challenge of retaining university students. These models are developed with the purpose of forecasting the probability of students either discontinuing their studies or successfully completing their academic path. Through the utilization of diverse machine learning algorithms and methods, these models offer valuable insights and practical suggestions to universities and educational institutions
